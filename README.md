## Electrophysiological signatures of Structural Priming in Chinese-English Bilingual Derivational Word Reading: *A Neurolinguistic study*

This repo contains my scripts for processing the EEG data in this neurolinguistic study:
* 1_Morbi_EEG_ERP: conventional univariate ERP analysis
* 2_RSA: representational similarity analysis between word vectors and multivariate neural response pattern
* 3_IS_RSA: intersubejct representational similarity analysis of english proficiency & english words neural representation
